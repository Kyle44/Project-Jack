StickFigure (Tad will work on this mostly)
	- Draw laser sight when charging long range attack
	- Customization
LocalPlayer
	- Fix controls
		* Number of players = num of controllers plugged in + keyboard, if num of controllers < 4
			For n players, players 1-n use controller, player n uses keyboard
		* Set default to aim priority: right stick > leftstick > last direction you fired
	- Add name property

Game Modes
	- Implement GameScreen interface to make something like the "SingleMap" class, but
		for each game mode
		* Match_TDM
			- Randomly assign 4 players to teams
			- Make colors of teammates similar
			- In player constructors, making the collision categories of the
				each player in a pair the same to handle friendly fire
		* Match_FreeForAll
			- Pretty much how SingleMap is now, but add stuff like endgame
				conditions/rounds
			- Probably best to start here, then do TDM
		* Match_OneVsAll
			- Same as TDM, but only one player has a different collision cat
			- Tweak end game so that lone player wins if timer runs out
	- Pass parameters in constructors for things listed under "Custom games" in 
		project doc
		* For maps, pass file name, and load map from file in constructor probably
